# Airbnb-Analysis
 The goal of this analysis is to understand the key factors influencing Airbnb listing performance in terms of pricing, reviews, and location. This is a fundamental analysis for identifying trends and patterns that could aid both hosts and guests in improving or selecting listings

** Data Collection & Cleaning:
**
Data was collected from Airbnb listing information. The dataset contains various columns such as room type, price, number of reviews, and geographical data.

Cleaning steps involved filling or dropping missing values, especially in columns like reviews_per_month and last_review. Any irrelevant or duplicate rows were removed to ensure accurate analysis.

**Data Analysis:**

Descriptive statistics were generated to understand the central tendencies and dispersions in key variables like price and number_of_reviews.

Relationships between room_type, price, and neighbourhood were examined to identify patterns that could influence the listing prices.

We explored correlations between numerical variables like price, reviews_per_month, and availability.

**Data Visualization:**

Various charts (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) were used to represent data distribution and the relationship between variables like price vs. room type and neighbourhood.

Geospatial visualizations were also created to showcase how listings are spread across different neighbourhoods in the city.

**Trend Analysis:**

Identified price trends based on room type and neighbourhood, helping pinpoint where the most lucrative listings are located.

A trend analysis was conducted to uncover peak times in reviews and availability.

**Summary:**

Key insights were drawn from the analysis, which included the impact of location on listing price, how room types affect occupancy and reviews, and which features most influence pricing.

The analysis also highlighted areas for hosts to improve their listings in terms of reviews and visibility.
